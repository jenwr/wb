This is the readme file under the new branch named according to the date. Watch how the merge works.
This is the Oct25 branch. Opened it in Explorer (Windows Explorer) and that showed the files in the directory. This is the markdown file that I have edited to make new changes.
So, on Oct31 I have new text in the README.md file.
Now there will be new changes to commit.

Again, on Oct31 I am adding more text using atom access from Windows Explorer.

So, here's the deal...
1. Opened GitHub on the desktop.
2. View files, map of the project showing the master and branch (Oct25).
3. Right clicked on repository (wb) for the option to open in Explorer where I can see the list of files. NOTE: This step unnecessary. Atom is featured within the GitHub interface in the upper right-hand corner near the settings gear.
4. Selected README.md (this file) and open with ATOM.
5. Made changes and
6. Saved

Notice: Atom indicates in the footer:
CRLF, UTF-8, GitHub Markdown, branchname, summary of changes

Save and continue.
